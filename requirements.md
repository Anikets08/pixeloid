Interactive Photo Canvas To Instagram Stories Integration
Task: Create a feature where a user can:

Capture a photo using the device's camera.

Interact with the captured photo on a canvas by drawing on it and adding stickers from a provided sticker library.

Write a caption for the photo.

Share the photo and caption directly to Instagram Stories.

Requirements:

Implement a camera interface for photo capture.

Load the captured photo onto a canvas for freehand drawing.

Use stickers from the provided Figma link: Project Status Stickers

Allow users to export or discard the edited photo.

Allow the user to input a caption after taking the photo.

It should open IG stories directly, not the native share modal.

Ensure a smooth transition from your app to Instagram.
